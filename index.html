                <p class="first-article-text">There are still rumors about the recent riots at the Ministry of Magic,
                    during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was seen again.
                    — Don't ask about anything, we are forbidden to talk about it, — said a very agitated Memory Eraser,
                    who wished to remain anonymous, at the exit of the Ministry last night.
                    However, high-ranking sources in the Ministry confirm that the legendary Hall of Prophecies was at
                    the center of the unrest.
                    Although Ministry officials still refuse to even confirm that such a place exists, a significant
                    part of the wizarding community is convinced that the Death Eaters currently serving time in Azkaban
                    for illegal invasion and attempted robbery wanted to steal some kind of prophecy. No one knows what
                    the essence of the prophecy is, but many believe that it concerns Harry Potter — the only person, as
                    far as we know, who managed to survive after the Deadly spell and, as we learned, was present at the
                    Ministry on the night when he said.</p>

                <h2 class="second-article-title">Some information</h2>
                <p class="second-article-text">Black is still at large! Today, the Ministry of Magic announced that
                    Sirius Black — the most dangerous
                    criminal in the history of Azkaban prison — has not yet been caught.
                    "We are doing everything we can to find Black," Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, assured this
                    morning, "and
                    we urge the wizarding community to remain calm.</p>
                <p class="second-article-text">Some members of the International Federation of Warlocks are unhappy that
                    Fudge reported the incident
                    to the Muggle Prime Minister.
                    — And what would you do in my place? — said Fudge, known for his irritable temper. —
                    Black is crazy.</p>
                <p class="second-article-text">He is dangerous, both for wizards and Muggles. The prime minister swore
                    that about the magical origin
                    No Muggle will recognize Black. And if they find out, they will consider it a reporter's duck.
                    Muggles were informed that Black has a gun (an iron pipe with which the simpletons kill each other).
                    The wizarding community fears a repeat of the massacre staged by Black twelve years ago. Recall,
                    then Black killed thirteen people with one curse at once.</p>
